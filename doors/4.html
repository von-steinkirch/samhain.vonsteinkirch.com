                        today, we begin to define the content of our spell<br>
                        (a spell rooted in pure, kind, unwavering love)

                        this first part is dedicated to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gtt4Nv7YRGM" target="_blank">soulmate</a><br>
                        (whether we've met them yet or not)

                        in the hierarchy of love that guides us<br>
                        our Creator comes first<br>
                        then our life partner<br>
                        and finally our creations
                        
                        <br><br>

                        <br>

                        a soulmate is your best friend, your lover, your family<br>
                        they're someone who stays with you until the end — and always<br>
                        someone who lifts you up, expecting nothing in return<br>
                        someone who feels like home, wherever you are<br>
                        someone who can read your mind && heart without a word<br>
                        someone with whom you can be your full, unguarded self<br>
                        someone who chooses only you, eternally, forever<br>
                        someone with whom you become more than 2 — in G'd

                        <br><br>

                        the value of marriage is among the most sacred paths one can take<br>
                        (any other extrapolation is a distraction from life's higher purpose)

                        <br>
                        
                        write down what your soul truly needs in a partner (<a href="https://gist.github.com/von-steinkirch/72c301b386b46f668a754ac2da53457a" target="_blank">mine is here</a>)<br>
                        without knowing who they are yet, picture your life with them<br>
                        imagine your days, your shared work, your creations<br>
                        fill your heart with the love you're ready to give<br>
                        and trust that G'd is guiding you to them

                        <br><br>

                        light a new candle<br>
                        read your list aloud<br>
                        feel the blessing of true love<br>
                        as it moves toward you<br>
                        let the candle burn<br>
                        let it go
