                    happy monday, beautiful anon<br>
                    day 2 of our sacred journey<br><br>
                    </span>

                    let's get ready together for<br>
                     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FsUHLLygCI&list=LL" target="_blank">the best new moon of the year</a><br>
                    (when the fun actually starts)

                    <br> <br>

                    but first, we need to do some housekeeping!<br>
                    yesterday, we honored what we're grateful for<br>
                    today, as we get ready for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/0PUu2CpIdII" target="_blank">crescent moon cycle</a><br>
                    we will purify our bodies and minds<br>
                    while diving deeper into the shadows<br>
                    to find the light within

                    <br> <br>

                        <em>"the cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek"</em><br>
                    — joseph campbell</span>    

                    <br> <br>

                    today's task is about <strong>shadow work</strong><br>
                    the ancient practice of embracing all parts of ourselves<br>
                    even the ones we've hidden away

                    <br> <br>

                    here's the 3 things we'll do:

                    <br><br>

                    <span style="color: #8B008B; font-weight: bold;">1. purify your home</span><br>
                    light another candle and put on some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yksJDZ0pVBQ&list=WL&index=13" target="_blank">schubert</a><br>
                    find what's messy and clean it up while dancing<br>
                    let joy move through your body<br><br>
                    
                    <span style="color: #8B008B; font-weight: bold;">2. purify up your body</span><br>
                    prepare a nice bath<br>
                    (i usually add epsom salt for grounding)<br>
                    (and perhaps some oils, like lavender or chamomile)<br>
                    let your muscles relax<br>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oDO6hAq7Qk&list=LL&index=4" target="_blank">let your breath deepen</a><br><br>

                    <span style="color: #8B008B; font-weight: bold;">3. purify up your mind</span><br>
                    write down 12 things about yourself that<br>
                    you are — or once were — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0wqyVBZzN8&list=WL&index=16" target="_blank">ashamed of</a><br>
                    things you've been carrying in secret for far too long<br>
                    now, instead of judging them<br>
                    ask yourself<br><br>
                    
                    <em><span style="color: #8B008B; font-weight: bold;">why am i carrying this weight? <br>
                        what is this part of me trying to protect me from? <br>
                        does it have a purpose?</em></span><br><br>
                    
                    remember when you were a kid, perhaps 7 or 8 years old?<br>
                    (<a href="https://ia904508.us.archive.org/33/items/the-prophet-khalil-gibran-1/The%20Prophet-Khalil-Gibran1_text.pdf" target="_blank">just discovering the world and yourself</a>)<br><br>

                    <em>
                    would this little you judge you for your mistakes?<br>
                    would this little you judge you for your brokenness?<br>
                    would this little you judge you for your beauty?<br>
                    would this little you judge you for your light?<br>
                    would this little you judge you for your dark?<br>

                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYD--jQE44A" target="_blank">would this little you still love you?</a></em><br><br>

                    i think so<br><br>

                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZCEEQht5-s&list=LL" target="_blank">you are whole, you are complete</a><br>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADzehrUgzGg&list=LL&index=3" target="_blank">even in your brokenness, you area absolutely perfect</a><br>

                    <br>

                    burn the list<br>
                    let it go

                    <br> <br>

                    see you tomorrow for day 3<br>
                    (hint: it involves vampires)<br>
                    the veil grows thinner...
