                        what's forgiveness?

                        forgiveness is the act of letting go of resentment and anger towards someone who has wronged you.

                        can i forgive the man who told me he would marry me and he loved me, but instead he destroyed my reputation and shared
                        my private life with entiere world in a way that i can never recover from? or go back from? a man i took in my sacred space home and 
                        and considered a good friend? a man i went to visit his family on thanksgiving? a man who stole my ideas? who tried to destroyed
                        my career, my soul, my future, everything i had? i man who lied in my face for years? a man so evil who still thinks what he did
                        was not one of the most horrencdous crimes in our generation? a man who proved that human traffic can happen to everyone,
                        even the silly brazilian woman who works all day, all life, and just wanted to make the world a better place? a man who has absolyutely
                        no achivemtns in his own life, and the biggest thing he has ever done was destroy every woman who believe in his lies?

                        yes, i can. becuase i refuse to let this pain and sufferering control any other day of my life. the damage is done, and it
                        already changhed me forever, how can i ever recover from this? the only way to move forward is to forgive, and let go of the anger and resentment.

                        does this man deserves go to jail and maybe get life in prison? yes, he does. and he will. this is just how justice works.
                        forggivenes is my personal choice to deal with the deads from evil. justice is for the law, forgiveness is for the heart.
