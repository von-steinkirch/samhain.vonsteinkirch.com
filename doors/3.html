                        today we will spend time in our dreams, both awake and asleep

                        part I: the walk<br>
                        <br>
                        let's go for a walk together
                        <br>
                        during the walk, i want you to convince yourself that there is nothing more important
                        in your life thant the following four things, in this order:
                        <br>
                        1. your relationship with the divine, with something that is beyond and bigger than you, and you won't ever be able to fanthom completely<br>
                        2. your relationship with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr12yDWzToI" target="_blank">the person who most complements you during your existence</a>, 
                        that one person who understand you, who cheers you, and who accepts the challenge of building something together with you under the divine's guidance.
                        and if this person is not yet in your life, i want you to believe with every fiber of your being that after we finish this spell, this person will enter your life<br>
                        3. your relationship with your creation: both your work and your children<br>
                        <br>
                    </p>

                    part II: the dream<br>
                    <p>
                        now we will try to lucid dream our reality<br>
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_EUg4uvULM" target="_blank">you are safe, you are sound, you are asleep</a><br>
                        there are many ways to do this, but i want you to try the following<br>
                        Before sleeping, repeat a phrase like:
                        “Next time I’m dreaming, I will remember I’m dreaming.”
                    </p>
