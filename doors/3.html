                    gm, my dear anon
                    
                    <br><br>
                       
                    an important aspect of magick is to sustain a state of bliss where no one can affect you<br>
                    (i believe this is the only way true free will can be realized)

                    <br>
                    
                    you reach this state only after completing all your shadow work<br>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBrd_3VMC3c" target="_blank">(the completely forgiviness and acceptance of yourself)</a>
                    
                    <br><br>

                    but even after this work, you may sometimes return to lower states<br>
                    the world is a strong force constantly trying to pull you down<Br>
                    your ability to create your reality is directly tied to<br>
                    your ability to keep yourself in high frequencies
                    
                    <br><br>

                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n-hyA2-FDg" target="_blank">there are many ways to enter this flow state</a><br>
                    one of them is through music and dance<br>
                    (songs are spells, so be mindful of anything you ingest)<br>
                    both spoken and written words are the main tool for materization<br>
                    (it took me a while to digest this part, but it's so fundamental <br>
                    and it's one of the most powerful meanings behind holy books like the bible)

                    <br><br>
                    
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfK6owGIceE" target="_blank">in this blissful state, you become one with your "little one"</a><br>
                    (you are one with your past self and your future self)<br>
                    (you unite with the parts of you that are truly beautiful, innocent, pure, and perfect)<br>
                    (and no one else is more important than every one of you)
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGfeCe0DHtI" target="_blank">this is what i want you to try</a><br>
                    be so free from anyone's opinion that your world is absolutely protected from harm<br>
                    even if you are in a literal prison<br>
                    (especially, if you live in a literal prison)
                    
                    <br><br>

                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQDaop9onHE" target="_blank">only then you can materize a better world for everyone else</a>
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    therefore, today's work is to mediate about the impact of the words, spoken or written<br>
                    tomorrow we will use this to create our reality

                        <br>

                        ah, you may ask, where are the vampires i promised?
                        
                        <br>
                        
                        well, vampires wil be one of the themes of this journey<br>
                        (<a href="https://choices.vonsteinkirch.com/choices/choose-your-adventure/storytelling/the-usdchoice-of-hero/become-a-storyteller/gaf" target="_blank">i love them</a>, 
                        i grew up believing i was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer" target="_blank">buffy</a> :))
                        
                        <br><br>

                        but for today, i want to introduce another special trick of magick:<br>
                        <i>harvesting energy from the place you are in</i><br>
                        (that's one of the reasons i've lived a nomadic life for many years now)<br>
                        every place has a unique feeling that transports you to a certain state of mind<br>
                        every time you arrive in a new place, it's like a fresh start, a blank canvas<br>
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fcepef6n4nk" target="_blank">and i like to use this energy to fuel my stories</a>
                        
                        <br><br>

                        for this experiment, i am harvesting the energy from<br>
                        one of the coolest places you can be as an <i>oficial magi</i>:<br>
                        new orleans, the city of vampires, and ghosts, and jazz<br>
                        (get ready to explore with me in the following chapters)
